# MTT-GH-Fundamentals

## Lab Instructions

### Lab 1: Create a GH Issue
Report an existing issue in the content by opening a new issue in the original repo. This is the most common way to report an issue. Providing:

    - A descriptive title linked to the Lab and Issue
    - Clear issue description
    - Include screenshots or other media
    - (In lab 4) Include a link to the PR that fixes the issue

### Lab 2: Create your first Pull Request (Beginner)
Create a PR directly from the GitHub UI in the original repo. This is the easiest way to create a PR. You can also create a PR from a forked repo, but that is a bit more complicated.

**ISSUE**: Simple typo in the `Lab1.md` file, for example, bold text is not closed.

### Lab 3: Create a Pull Request (Intermediate)
Create a PR from a forked repo. This is the most common way to create a PR. You will need to create a fork of the original repo, make changes to the fork, and then create a PR from the fork to the original repo.

**ISSUE**: Multiple formatting issues in the `Lab1.md` file. Tables with wrong formatting, NOTE with incorrect indentation, etc.
### Lab 3: Create a Pull Request (Advanced)
Create a PR from the forked repo, proposing a image update.

**ISSUE**: The image in the `Lab1.md` file is outdated and contains trainer personal data. The image should be updated to reflect the latest UI changes. Use tools like Snagit to capture the new image and propose the change in the PR.

### Lab 4: Review a Pull Request (Intermediate)
Imagine you are the Content Owner/Courseware Lead. Review and collaborate with the contributor to make sure the PR is ready to merge.

You will include a reference to the GH Issues that are fixed by this PR.

## Lab 5: Review a Pull Request (Advanced)
Imagine you are the Content Owner/Courseware Lead. Review and collaborate with the contributor to make sure the PR is ready to merge.

You will suggest a change to the proposed PR. The contributor will need to accept the change and update the PR.
