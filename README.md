# MTT-GH-Fundamentals

This document contains the instructions for the MTT GH Fundamentals lab. The lab is designed to teach the basics of GitHub and how to use it to contribute to the MOC content used by MTTs.

The scenarios proposed in this lab are based on the real-life scenarios that MTTs face when contributing to the MOC content. It is composed of the following components:

- An **Source Repo (also called "Upstream")** that contains a simulated MOC content (https://github.com/MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals). As mentioned on the learning material, the original repo is the source of truth for the content. It is the repo that contains the latest version of the content. The original repo is owned by the Content Owner (Content Devs in a real life scenario). As MTTs or learners, we can report issues and propose changes to the content by opening a PR in the original repo, **but we are not allowed to change it directly**.
- A **Forked repo (also called "Origin")** that contains a copy of the original repo. The forked repo is owned by the contributor (MTT in a real life scenario). The forked repo is used to **make changes to the content and propose them to the original repo**.

![Upstream and Fork](media/upstreamandfork.png)

You could also involve a local clone (copy) of the repo in your local machine. **This is not required for the lab, it will try to teach the easiest way to collaborate with GitHub, only using web interface tooling**. 

You can perfectly collaborate in the MOC content without cloning the repo to your local machine. You can use the GitHub web interface to open issues, create PRs, review PRs, etc. This is the most common way to collaborate in GitHub as MTTs.


## Pre-requisites
- Make sure you have a **GitHub account**. If you don't have one, you can create one for free at https://github.com/join. Identify yourself as Microsoft MTT in your Profile (TODO guidelines?).
- Review the Learning material in ADD WEBSITE.

## Repository Structure
The repository is composed of the following files/folders:
- **README.md**: This file. Contains the instructions for the lab.
- **Instructions** folder: Contains the instructions for the demo lab we will collaborate in.
    - **media** folder: Contains the images used in the instructions.
    - **Lab1.md**: Instructions for the first demo lab.

## Lab Instructions

### Lab 1: Create a GH Issue
In this lab you are going to report an existing issue in the content by opening a new issue in the source repo (Upstream). This is the most common way to report an issue. 

GitHub Issues are used not only to report bugs, but also to propose new features, ask questions, etc (you can use labels for categorizing). It is something similar to work items used by Azure DevOps.

When creating a new issue, you should provide:
- A descriptive title linked to the Lab and Issue
- Clear issue description
- Include screenshots or other media (if that helps to understand the issue)
- (Done in [Lab 2](#lab-2-create-a-pull-request-intermediate)) Include a link to the PR that fixes the issue.

#### Exercise

1. Make sure you are in the MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals repo. You are going to use the source repository to report an issue found in the lab.
1. Go to the [Lab1.md](Instructions/Lab1.md) file.

1. On Exercise 1 > Task 1 you can see there is an issue with the table format. You will be reporting this issue in the source repo (Upstream).

    ![Table issue](media/table-issue.png)

1. Click on the **Issues** tab in the repo (make sure you are in the MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals repo). Click on the **New issue** button.

1. Provide a descriptive title for the issue. For example: **Lab 1: E1T1 - Table format is not correct**.
1. Provide a description to the issue. For example:

    ```The table format is not correct. The table is not rendered correctly in the GitHub UI.```
1. Include an image of the issue. You can use the Snagit tool (or others) to capture the image and pointing the problem. You can attach it just by **pasting** into the issue description.

1. Click on the **Submit new issue** button. Your issue should be created and look similar to the following [issue](https://github.com/MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals/issues/2)  (some exercises to be done still ):

    ![Reference issue](media/reference-issue.png)

1. You may need to collaborate further using the **comment section** of the issue, which is used fo conversation with other users and content owners (you can tag people using "@").
1. Content Owners may also add labels to the issue to categorize it. For example, adding the **bug** label to the issue.

1. Once reviewed and fixed, the issue will be closed by the Content Owner. You will still work on the issue during next labs. 


### Lab 2: Create a Pull Request (Beginner)
You are going to create a PR from a forked repo. This is the most common way to collaborate on a public repository (as many OSS projects do). You will need to create a fork of the source repo (upstream), make changes to a branch in the fork, and then create a PR from the fork to the upstream repo (source).

Before starting, lets cover some basic concepts:

- A repository being public **does NOT mean anyone can make changes to it**. You need to be granted permissions to do so or **you need to propose changes using a fork of the source repo for experimentation**. In the case of the MOC content, only the Content Owner (Content Devs in a real life scenario) has permissions to make changes to the original repo. MTTs need to collaborate using PRs.
- A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge changes from a branch in a forked repo to a branch in the source repo. The PR is used to propose changes to the source repo. The PR is a conversation between the contributor and the Content Owner. The Content Owner will review the PR and collaborate with the contributor to make sure the PR is ready to merge. The PR is the most common way to collaborate in GitHub.
- In your case you will have:
    - MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals repo (Upstream): The **source repo**. The "stable" version of the content. The repo that contains the original content.
    - YOUR-ORG-OR-ACCOUNT/MTT-GH-Fundamentals repo (Fork): The **forked repo**. A copy of the source repo in your GitHub account. You will be making changes to this repo.

#### Exercise

1. Go to the MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals repo (if not there already). Lets try to make a change to the source repo to see what happens.
1. In **Code** tab, go to the `Instructions/Lab1.md` file. Look for the following table syntax issue reported on previous lab. 

    ![Table issue](media/table-issue.png)

1. Open the editor clicking on the edit icon (pencil, top right corner). You will see the following warning message:

    ![edit warning](media/edit-warning.png)

1. The warning explains how a fork has been created for you to experiment on your proposed changes (as you do not have write permissions to the source repo). The proposed changes will be made in a branch in your forked repo. You will need to create a PR from your fork to the source repo to propose the changes.

1. Start by proposing the change to the table format. You can use the **Preview** tab to see how the table will look like once the changes are applied.

    ![table fix](media/table-fix.png)

1. Go to the bottom and on the **Propose changes** section, provide a descriptive message for the commit. For example: **Fix table format**. Leave the **extended description** empty. Click on **Propose changes**.
1. At this point you have made the **changes to a branch(default name given, for example, "patch-1") in your forked repo**. You need to create a PR from your fork to the source repo to propose the changes. The GitHub UI will guide you through the process of opening a PR from your fork to the source repo.

    ![PR UI](media/pr-ui.png)

1. As you can see in the image above, GitHub is proposing you to open a PR **from** a branch your forked repo **to** the default branch of the source repo. You can change the source and target branches if needed. Click on **Create pull request**.

1. In the **Open a pull request** window, provide a descriptive title for the PR. For example: **Fix table format in Lab1.md**. Provide a description to the PR. For example:

    ```The table format is not correct. The table is not rendered correctly.```    
1. As this PR is trying to fix and existing&reported issue, you can include a reference to the issue (use your Issue number #) in the PR description.**This is great to trace the status of the issue from both the Issue or PR (on the Development field of the items, right column)**. Include a reference to the issue in the PR description. For example:

    ```Fixes #2```

1. Click on **Create pull request**. Your PR should be created and look similar to the following [PR](https://github.com/MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals/pull/3).

1. Now if you open the GH Issue from lab one, you will see a reference to the PR that fixes the issue. 

    ![issue reference](media/issue-reference.png)


### Lab 3: Create a Pull Request (Intermediate)
Create a PR from the forked repo, proposing a image update.

**ISSUE!** The image in the example lab file at`Instructions/Lab1.md` is outdated and contains trainer personal data. The image should be updated to reflect the latest UI changes. Use tools like Snagit to capture the new image and propose the change in the PR.

This time you will use a different way to edit files on GitHub. You will still use the GitHub UI for it (no local or cloned repo used, to simplify the process). Advanced developers may prefer to use a local repo and a local editor to make changes to the files. This is out of scope for this lab.

#### Exercise

1. Go to the forked repository "YOUR-ORG-OR-ACCOUNT/MTT-GH-Fundamentals" on GitHub (if not there already).

1. You will open the GitHub Web Editor by clicking on "." on your keyboard. You can also lightly change the URL to **github.dev/...** instead of **github.com/...**. This will open the GitHub Web Editor which works as a Visual Studio Code editor in the browser.

    ![github.dev](media/github-dev.png)

    >**NOTE:** The GitHub Web Editor is a great way to make quick edits to files in a repo. It cannot be used for testing or running code. For that you will need to clone the repo and use a local editor or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) 

1. Start by creating a new branch to propose the mentioned changes. On the bottom left corner, click on the **main** branch and select **Create new branch**. Provide a descriptive name for the branch. For example: **update-image**. Click on **Enter** and **Switch to branch**.

    ![create branch](media/create-branch2.png)

1. Now your repository will be pointing to the new **update-image** branch. You can start making changes to the files in the repo.

1. In order to edit Markdown files, it is helpful to open the **Markdown Previewer**. Open the **Instructions/Lab1.md** file and click on the **Open Markdown to the side** icon on the top right corner.

    ![markdown previewer](media/open-preview.png)

1. Review the **Lab1.md** file and you will see in line 51 that the image **create-webapp-v1.png** contains personal data. You will need to update the image to reflect the latest UI changes and avoid personal data. Use tools like **Snagit** to capture the new image and propose the change in the PR.

1. Use your preferred tools to capture a new **Create Web App** screenshot, hide personal data and save it locally as **create-webapp-v2.png**. 

    ![Updated Image](media/create-webapp-v2.png)

1. Upload the picture to **Instructions/media** folder by right clicking on the folder and selecting **Upload files**. Upload the new image.

1. Go to the lab file **Instructions/Lab1.md** and update the image reference in line 51 to the new image. For example:

    ```![Create Web App](media/create-webapp-v2.png)```

1. Create a new commit for these changes. Click on the **Source Control** icon on the left menu. You will see the changes you have made to the files in the repo. Provide a descriptive message for the commit. For example: **updated image that contained personal data**. Click on **Commit and push**.

    ![commit changes](media/commit-push.png)

1. As you do not need the old version of the screenshot, delete the old **create-webapp-v1.png** file. Click on the **Source Control** icon on the left menu. Create another commit as before, providing a descriptive message for the commit. For example: **deleted old image that contained personal data**. Click on **Commit and push**.

1. Go back to the repository page at **github.com/...** At this point you have a ready merge new branch on your forked repo. You need to create a PR from your fork to the source repo to propose the changes. The GitHub UI will guide you through the process of opening a PR from your fork to the source repo. (You could also open the PR from the **Source Control** tab in the GitHub Web Editor)

    ![PR UI](media/update-image-branch.png)

1. Click on **Compare and pull request**. Make sure your are targeting the **main** branch of the source repo from your forked repo **update-image** branch. Provide a descriptive title for the PR. For example: **Update image that contained personal data**. Provide a description to the PR and reference to the existing #4 GitHub Issue, and create the Pull Request. For example:

    ```
    The image in the example lab file at Instructions/Lab1.md is outdated and contains trainer personal data. The image should be updated to reflect the latest UI changes. 

    Fixes #4
    ```

You successfully edited the forked repository using the GitHub Web Editor and created a PR to propose the changes to the source repo.

### Lab 4: Review a Pull Request (Beginner)
Imagine you are the Content Owner/Courseware Lead. Review and collaborate with the contributor to make sure the PR is ready to merge.

You will include a reference to the GH Issues that are fixed by this PR.

#### Exercise

In this exercise you will review an existing Pull Request to understand the artifacts included and necessary steps to approve/merge a PR. **You will only review the existing options as part of the exercise, no actions expected! (the content dev usually takes the ownership of this part)**. 

1. Go to the source repository "MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals" on GitHub.
1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Open the Pull Request with title **[REFERENCE] Fix table format in Lab1.md**. It is a PR similar to the one done in Lab 2, it fixes a table format in the Lab1.md file.
1. On the **Conversation** tab, you can review the conversation between the contributor and the reviewer. You can see the PR actitity, changes/commits, comments, approval, etc. 
1. On the **Commits** tab, you can review the commits included in the PR.
1. On the **Checks** (not used in this labs) tab, you can review the status of the checks included in the PR. Checks are validations for your code you can automatically execute in a GitHub Actions (like linting, building code, unit testing, etc.).
1. On the **Files changed** tab, you can review the files included in the PR and the changes proposed. You can also **add comments** to the PR on specific lines of code (using the "+" icon).
1. On the **Development** tab, you can see the related issues (either added manually or automatically by using the **Fixes #X** syntax on the PR description).
1. (For content Developers) As you can see on the reference PR, on the **Reviewers** field, a reviewer has been assigned (by the maintainer). The reviewer will have to review the proposed changes (**Files changed** tab), provide feedback and approve the PR. Once the PR is approved, the maintainer will merge the PR to the main branch. 

    ![PR UI](media/PR-approve.png)

    

**As an MTT you could help Content Developer by reviewing the proposed changes and providing feedback/comments.**

If the PR would be merged (left opened on purpose for review), you would see the following:
- The PR would merge changes to the main branch of the source repository.
- The PR would be closed.
- The referenced Issue would be closed.

    ![PR UI](media/PR-merged.png)

On this lab you have reviewed an existing Pull Request to understand the artifacts included and necessary steps to approve/merge a PR.


## Lab 5: Review a Pull Request (Intermediate)
Imagine you are the Content Owner/Courseware Lead. Review and collaborate with the contributor to make sure the PR is ready to merge.

This time, a change will be suggested to the proposed PR. The contributor will need to accept the change and update the PR.

#### Exercise

In this exercise you will review an existing Pull Request to understand the artifacts included and necessary steps to approve/merge a PR. **You will only review the existing options as part of the exercise, no actions expected! (the content dev usually takes the ownership of this part)**.

1. Go to the source repository "MS-ESI/MTT-GH-Fundamentals" on GitHub.
1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Open the Pull Request with title **[REFERENCE] Update image that contained personal data**. It is a PR similar to the one done in Lab 3, it fixes image that contained personal data.

Let´s imagine, as a Content Developer, you want to suggest a change to the opened PR (PR not ready to merge). You can add a comment and wait for the change or **suggest the change you are looking for**. Lets review the second option.

1. On the **Files changed** tab, you could suggest a change on line 51, clicking on the **Suggest a change** button.

    ![PR UI](media/PR-suggest-change.png)

1. Lets imagine we would like a more complete ALT text for the image: As a maintainer , you would include the following and **Submit a review**:

    ```suggestion
        ![Create WebApp page in Azure Portal](media/create-webapp-v2.png)
    ```
1. Now the PR creator would get a message with the changes asked by the maintainer and can **Commit suggestion**.

    ![PR UI](media/PR-commit-suggestion.png)

On this lab, you have reviewed an existing PR and reviewed how to suggest a change to the PR creator.
